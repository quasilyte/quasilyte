I worked on [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify) static analyzer for PHP and [KPHP compiler](github.com/VKCOM/kphp/) at [vk.com](https://github.com/VKCOM/). Before that, I was a part of Intel Go team: I added AVX-512 support and some compiler optimizations there, but
most of the time I was tinkering on the Go x86-64 assembler.

I try to maintain several<sup>[[1]](https://go-critic.github.io/)</sup> good<sup>[[2]](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify)</sup> static<sup>[[3]](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-consistent)</sup> analyzers<sup>[[4]](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard)</sup>.<br>
Sometimes I create dev tools like [phpgrep](https://github.com/quasilyte/phpgrep) (structural PHP code search using AST patterns).

Some facts about me:
* I enjoy [3D-printing](https://www.instagram.com/quasilyte3d/) and [drawing](https://quasilyte.dev/gopherkon/)
* My tech talks and articles can be found at [github.com/quasilyte/talks](https://github.com/quasilyte/talks)
